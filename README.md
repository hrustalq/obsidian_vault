| COUCHDB_CORS_ORIGINS | string | CORS allowed origins | `*` or `https://mydomain.com` | `*` |
| COUCHDB_DOMAIN | string | CouchDB domain/hostname | `localhost` or `couchdb.example.com` | `localhost` |

### CI/CD Environment Variables

Additional variables used in GitHub Actions workflow:

| Name | Type | Description | Used In |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| SSH_HOST | string | Server IP address or domain | Deployment |
| SSH_USERNAME | string | SSH username on target server | Deployment |
| SSH_KEY | string | Private SSH key content | Deployment |
| SSH_PORT | number | SSH port number | Deployment (default: 22) |
| DEPLOY_PATH | string | Deployment directory path | Deployment |

## GitHub Actions & Deployment

The project includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with the following features:

### 🔍 **Validation & Testing**
- Docker Compose configuration validation
- Automated container startup and health checks
- Smart timeout handling with progressive feedback
- Comprehensive CouchDB API testing

### 🛡️ **Security Scanning**
- **Configuration Scan**: Checks Docker Compose and config files
- **Filesystem Scan**: Scans for vulnerabilities in project files
- **Severity Filtering**: Focuses on CRITICAL, HIGH, and MEDIUM issues
- **GitHub Security Integration**: Results appear in Security tab

### 🚀 **Automated Deployment**
- SSH-based deployment to your server
- Intelligent health checks with 90-second timeout
- Automatic recovery attempts on failure
- Authentication testing for CouchDB credentials
- Concurrency control to prevent conflicting deployments

### 🔧 **Workflow Features**
- **Parallel Execution**: Validation and security scans run simultaneously
- **Conditional Deployment**: Only runs on main branch pushes
- **Graceful Failure**: Skips deployment if secrets aren't configured
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive error reporting and diagnostics

### GitHub Secrets Configuration

For automated deployment to your server, you'll need to set up SSH keys and configure secrets.

**📖 [Complete SSH Setup Guide](./SSH_SETUP_GUIDE.md)**

#### Required Secrets for Deployment

| Secret Name | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `SSH_HOST` | Server IP address or domain | `192.168.1.100` or `example.com` |
| `SSH_USERNAME` | SSH username on target server | `ubuntu` or `root` |
| `SSH_KEY` | Private SSH key content | Full private key with headers |
| `DEPLOY_PATH` | Path where app is deployed | `/home/user/obsidian_vault` |
| `COUCHDB_PASSWORD` | Database password | `secure_password_123` |
| `SSL_CERT` | SSL certificate content | Full certificate with headers |
| `SSL_KEY` | SSL private key content | Full private key with headers |

#### Optional Secrets (with defaults)

| Secret Name | Default Value | Description |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| `COUCHDB_USER` | `obsidian_user` | Database username |
| `COUCHDB_CORS_ORIGINS` | `*` | CORS allowed origins |
| `COUCHDB_DOMAIN` | `localhost` | CouchDB domain/hostname |
| `SSH_PORT` | `22` | SSH port number |
| `PUID` | `99` | Process User ID |
| `PGID` | `100` | Process Group ID |
| `UMASK` | `0022` | File creation mask |
| `TZ` | `Asia/Shanghai` | Timezone |

### SSL Certificate Management via GitHub Secrets

You can store your SSL certificates securely in GitHub repository secrets for automated deployment:

#### How to Set Up SSL Certificate Secrets

1. **Get your SSL certificate files** (from Let's Encrypt, CA, or self-signed)
2. **Copy certificate content:**
   ```bash
   # For the SSL_CERT secret, copy the full certificate content:
   cat /path/to/your/certificate.crt
   # or for Let's Encrypt:
   cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem
   ```

3. **Copy private key content:**
   ```bash
   # For the SSL_KEY secret, copy the full private key content:
   cat /path/to/your/private.key
   # or for Let's Encrypt:
   cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem
   ```

4. **Add to GitHub repository secrets:**
   - Go to `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`
   - Add `SSL_CERT` with the certificate content (including `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` headers)
   - Add `SSL_KEY` with the private key content (including `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` headers)

#### Benefits of Using GitHub Secrets for SSL

- **🔒 Secure Storage**: Certificates are encrypted and never exposed in logs
- **🚀 Automated Deployment**: Certificates are automatically installed during deployment
- **🔄 Easy Updates**: Update certificates by changing secrets (no server access needed)
- **📝 Version Control**: No need to store sensitive certificates in your repository

### Deployment Workflow

When you push to the main branch:

1. **🔍 Validation**: Tests Docker Compose configuration
2. **🛡️ Security**: Scans for vulnerabilities
3. **🚀 Deploy**: SSH to server and deploy (if secrets configured)
   - Pulls latest code
   - Exports environment variables
   - Starts services with `make up`
   - Runs comprehensive health checks
   - Attempts automatic recovery on failure

## Data Persistence

CouchDB data is persisted in Docker volumes. Use `make backup` and `make restore` for data management.
